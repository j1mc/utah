"""scripts/clean-stage.sh must strip build residue without taking the keepers.

The script runs in the final Containerfile layer, and everything it deletes is
deleted from the image every flavor ships. Until now nothing executed it: the
only test that named it at all was the `bash -n` syntax gate, which proves the
file parses and nothing about what it removes. A wrong `-name` filter or a
dropped `\\!` would still parse, and the symptom would be either a `bootc
container lint --fatal-warnings` failure at the end of a full build or, worse,
an image that silently lost /var/cache/rpm-ostree.

The script already carries the seam these tests need: every path it touches is
prefixed with `CLEAN_ROOT`, documented in the script as being there "so the
script can be exercised against a temporary directory rather than the live
filesystem". These tests take it up on that -- they build a scratch tree that
mimics the offenders seen on real builds, run the real script against it, and
assert on the tree that survives.
